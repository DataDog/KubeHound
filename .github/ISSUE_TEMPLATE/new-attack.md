***Have you completed all the steps in the [Adding an Attack Guide](https://github.com/DataDog/KubeHound/blob/main/docs/ATTACKS.md)?***

If no, explain why this could not be completed

**Explain any performance considerations**
Does the attack have a `large_cluster_optimization`? Does the insert use any non-index properties? etc.
