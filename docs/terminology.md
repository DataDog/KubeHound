# Terminology

## Graph Theory

**Graph**

A data type to represent complex, non-linear relationships between objects

**Vertex**

The fundamental unit of which graphs are formed (aka ***node***)

**Edge**

A connection between vertices (aka ***relationship***)

**Path**

A sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices

**Traversal**

The process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph

## KubeHound

**Entity**

An abstract representation of a Kubernetes component that form the vertices of our attack graph. These do not necessarily correspond directly to a Kubernetes object, but represent a related construct in an attacker's mental model of the system. Each entity can be tied back to one (or more) Kubernetes object(s) from which it derived via vertex properties.

**Attack**

All edges in the KubeHound graph should represent a net improvement in an attackerâ€™s position or a lateral movement opportunity. Thus, if any two vertices in the graph are connected we know immediately that an attacker can move between them. As such ***attack*** and ***edge*** are used interchangeably throughout the project.

**Critical Asset**

An entity in KubeHound whose compromise would result in cluster admin (or equivalent) level access.
