# ENDPOINT_EXPLOIT

Represents a network endpoint exposed by a container that could be exploited by an attacker (via means known or unknown). This can correspond to a Kubernetes service, node service, node port, or container port.

## Details

Exposed endpoints represent the most common entry point for attackers into a cluster.

## Prerequisites

A network endpoint exposed by a container.

## Checks

Endpoints exposed outside the cluster can be queried via `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl get endpointslices
```

Alternatively open ports can be discovered by traditional port scanning techniques or a tool like [KubeHunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter#scanning-options)

## Exploitation

This edge simply indicates that an endpoint is exposed by a container. It does not signal that the endpoint is exploitable but serves as a useful starting point for path traversal queries.

## Defences

None
