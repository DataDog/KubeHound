# Queries

You can query KubeHound data stored in the JanusGraph database by using the [Gremlin query language](https://docs.janusgraph.org/getting-started/gremlin/). The project provides an augmented [KubeHound DSL](./dsl.md) covering the most common use cases. However, for traditionalists and power users a [cheatsheet](./gremlin.md) of pure gremlin queries for different use cases is also available.
